# `.vim`

Hello, if you stumbled here, you are probably interested in my 
`vim` config. This is the next generation of my Vim configuration.
It's still pretty rough, and heavily WIP, but it aspires to be much
more modular and well-documented than the previous one. This file
will take you through some of the details of it.

## Vim-Plug

Plugins are managed by `vim-plug`, which is currently included in this
repo for ease of installation. This is because git submodules and subtrees
suck.

All of the plugins can be installed after cloning this repo with `:PlugInstall`.

For the plugin repository, see [this repo](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
